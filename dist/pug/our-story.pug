						p At our factory, located in the community of Tashir (Kalinino) In the Lori region of the Republic of Armenia, we produce a range of cheese with blue mold, all the taste and quality features of which are due to the use of traditional European technologies and the high content of milk obtained in the region:
						p Blue mold cheese is considered a delicacy. It has a unique taste and a wonderful aroma that sharpens the taste senses of a person. This type of cheese is perfectly combined with various dishes, meat, pasta, fruit and wine. The cheese contains the penicillium roqueforti mold, which gives the cheese a blue-green color and a special taste. This type of mold is safe. Moreover, it is very useful and provides the human body with very important amino acids, vitamins and minerals, helping to increase human immunity.
						p We do not define large production as a goal, but attach importance to high quality, so we compete with well-known European brands.
